   - **Unique Languages:** The dataset includes 11 unique languages.
   - **Dominant Language:** English is the most frequent language, with 1,306 entries, highlighting its predominance in this dataset.

#### 3. **Type Analysis**
   - **Total Count:** The type classification is available for all entries (2,652).
   - **Types Recorded:** There are 8 unique types, with 'movie' being the most frequent, appearing 2,211 times, suggesting a strong focus on movies in this dataset.

#### 4. **Title Analysis**

   - **Unique Titles:** There are 2,312 unique titles, indicating a rich variety of media. 
   - **Most Common Title:** 'Kanda Naal Mudhal' appears 9 times, pointing to a possible notable entry within this dataset.

#### 5. **Contribution Analysis (Field: By)**
   - **Total Count:** Out of 2,652 entries, this field has 2390 recorded contributors.
   - **Unique Contributors:** A wide selection with 1,528 unique contributors.
   - **Most Frequent Contributor:** Kiefer Sutherland appears as the most frequent contributor with 48 entries, highlighting his significance in this dataset.
   - **Missing Values:** There are 262 missing entries in the contributor field, which may affect the analysis of contributor influence.

#### 6. **Rating Analysis**
   - The dataset includes three types of ratings: overall, quality, and repeatability.

   - **Overall Rating:**
     - Mean: Approximately 3.05, suggesting a generally positive reception.
     - Standard Deviation (SD): 0.76 indicates some diversity in the ratings, but it's not very high.
     - Median (50th percentile): 3.0, which means half the entries have an overall rating of 3 or below.
     - Range: The overall rating ranges from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5, with the highest frequency occurring at the mean.

   - **Quality Rating:**
     - Mean: Approximately 3.21, slightly higher than the overall rating, indicating that quality is perceived somewhat better than overall satisfaction.
     - SD: 0.80 shows variability in quality ratings.
     - Median: 3.0 suggests a central tendency similar to the overall rating.

   - **Repeatability Rating:**
     - Mean: About 1.49 indicates a lower perception of repeat viewing or listening.
     - SD: 0.60 shows less variability compared to overall and quality ratings.
     - Median: 1.0 signifies that many entries are not considered highly repeatable, likely affecting overall ratings as well.

#### 7. **Correlation Analysis**
   - **Overall Rating Correlation:**
     - There is a strong positive correlation (0.826) between overall and quality ratings, suggesting that better quality is associated with higher overall ratings.
     - Moderate correlation (0.513) between overall and repeatability suggests that more highly rated entries are somewhat likely to be also viewed or consumed again.
   - **Quality Correlation:**
     - Quality ratings also show moderate correlation with repeatability (0.312), indicating some level of consistency where quality may impact whether entries are viewed repeatedly.

### Conclusion
The dataset represents a significant body of work consisting mostly of English-language movies, with notable entries and contributors. Despite the reliable counts and types of analyses performed, the presence of missing values (especially in the date and contributor fields) may limit more nuanced insights. Ratings provided in various categories (overall, quality, repeatability) suggest a generally positive reception, although the shallow repeatability may point to content that isn't highly compelling for multiple viewings. Future steps could entail cleaning missing values and correlating them effectively to enhance data reliability for deeper analysis and insights.
