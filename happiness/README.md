#### Missing Values
- There are several missing values across various indicators:
  - Log GDP per capita: 28
  - Social support: 13
  - Healthy life expectancy at birth: 63
  - Freedom to make life choices: 36
  - Generosity: 81
  - Perceptions of corruption: 125

#### Correlation Analysis
The correlation matrix sheds light on the relationships between different variables:

- Strongest correlations:
  - **Life Ladder and Log GDP per capita**: 0.78. This suggests a robust connection wherein wealthier individuals generally report being happier.
  - **Life Ladder and Social Support**: 0.72, indicates high happiness levels are related to perceived social support.
  - **Log GDP per Capita and Healthy Life Expectancy at Birth**: 0.82, implying that wealthier nations tend to have healthier populations.

- Noteworthy negative correlations:
  - **Corruption Perception and Life Ladder**: -0.43 suggests that higher perceived corruption correlates with lower reported happiness.
  - **Negative Affect and Life Ladder**: -0.35 indicates that increased negative feelings are linked to lower happiness levels.

#### Conclusion
The dataset reveals significant socio-economic and subjective well-being insights over a span of years across diverse countries. The observed correlations highlight essential areas for potential growth and research, especially focusing on improving social support and reducing perceptions of corruption to enhance overall life satisfaction. Missing data need careful handling to ensure comprehensive analysis and accurate policy recommendations. Further investigations might consider exploring the contextual factors driving these trends, especially in regions exhibiting stark contrasts like Lebanon's frequent appearance despite varying happiness scores.
